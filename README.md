# Questions

Each question should have 4 tags at first:
  1) Company tag (which company has been known to ask a version of the question)
  	- In order to do this, we need a comprehensive list of the companies hiring for machine learning engineers
  2) Frequency tag (how often this question has been known to appear in an interview)
  3) Category Tag (We can start with 4 categories: Linear Algebra, Probability/Statistics, General Machine Learning, and Deep Learning)
  4) The difficulty level of the question (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
