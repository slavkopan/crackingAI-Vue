Inverse Transform Sampling

4.
Type: Probability/Statistics
Difficulty: Easy

Question:

You are given access to a fair coin which you can flip as many times as you choose. Explain how you could use this fair coin to simulate trials from a Uniform(0,1) Random variable.

Answer:
Flip/Segment

5.
Type: General Machine Learning
Difficulty: Medium

Question: When building a Random Forrest model, explain why it is important that the individual trees in the ensemble are as decorrelated as possible.

Answer: Variance of mean of random variables is 1/N^2 * (Sum of individual variances + 2*Pairwise covariances)

Type: General Machine Learning
Difficulty: Medium

Question: In the SVM framework, explain the signficance of the so called "Support Vectors". Why does this make prediction easy?

Answer: Support vectors are training points for which the dual variable is non zero. 
In dual formulation, prediction then only relies on those points, so don't have to save all points or large weights


7.
Type: General Machine Learning
Difficulty: Hard

Question: Explain the similarities/differences between Principal Components Regression and Ridge Regression. 

Answer: Differences, just explain what they are. 
Similarities: PCR ignores directions with small EVs, Ridge shrinks, makes XTX less singular, reduces impact of multicollinearity
